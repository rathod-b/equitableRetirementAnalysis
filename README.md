## Coal plant locations> these red dots are locations of coal plants under analysis.
## Eligible RE sites> these grey circles point to all eligible RE sites that are eligible for RE investments. These are under the threshold distance from a nearby coal plant.
## Sites w/ Investments: These RE sites were chosen by the model for investments.
## Sites online 2020: These RE sites were online RE sites in 2020, and are available to produce electricity.
## 0+ MW capacity: these sites are those with >0 MW capacity installed. IDEALLY these should be the same as sites online or sites with investment.
## RE Gen Magnitude: The size of circles denotes the magnitude of RE generation from that site.

If a RE site is online/has investment/has capacity/or is generating electricity but is not an eligible RE site, then it is an ineligible site.
